    ● parseExpression(string expression): Takes the expression as a string from the user and will break it
        down into numbers and operators
    ● validateExpression(string expression): This method will ensure proper usage of parentheses and
        operators
    ● evaluateExpression(string expression): This will be called upon by parseExpression after splitting
        input and ensuring its validity to make calls to our operators following PEMDAS
